## Description

This project aims to automate the interaction with a web application using Selenium WebDriver in JavaScript. The goal is to demonstrate how to locate and interact with elements on a webpage. 

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine
- Selenium WebDriver for JavaScript (`selenium-webdriver` package)
- A compatible web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) installed on your machine

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ashdude14/selenium-test.git
   cd your-repository
   npm install
   
## Usage

1. **Modify the XPath expressions in the JavaScript file (`your-script.js`) to match the elements you want to interact with on your target webpage.**

2. **Run the JavaScript file using Node.js:**
   ```bash
   node your-script.js
 The script will open a web browser, navigate to the specified webpage, locate the desired element(s) using the XPath expressions, and interact with them according to the instructions in your script.

## Example
An example script (example-script.js) is provided in this repository. You can use it as a template for creating your own automation scripts.

## Note
Make sure you are familiar with XPath expressions and HTML structure to effectively locate elements on a webpage.
Test your automation scripts thoroughly on different browsers and environments to ensure compatibility and reliability.
